	%I am a core member in the software development team that is responsible for creating a Clinical Trials Data Management System. I have led DFweb development, the web solution in DFdiscover suite. I designed the software architecture for DFweb, developed numerious features - data collection ability, query function, document management, and edit checks, built the next generation of our product, used by over 8000 users. I presented in DFUG 2018 to exhibit DFweb and then made the first release of DFweb. I wrote DFweb user guide documentation. DFweb is mainly developed using AngularJS, Angular 8, HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap 3, Web Assembly, and Restful API.
