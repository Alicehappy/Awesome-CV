\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I would like to learn my whole life if I can. I am the one who is always curious about the knowledge taught by teachers in the class,and will spend a lot of time reading tons of books after class in order to fully understand all the concepts and materials I learned.My classmates from elementary school to university often discuss class problems with me, as I like to share knowledge and myexplanation often makes more sense to them.

\lettersection{Why Amec Foster Wheeler?}
I attended Amec Foster Wheeler recruitment event at McMaster on Sep 26, and I learned a lot about the company with regard tocompany’s value, structure, career path, and etc. from the managers’ speeches. I am thrilled about this 2.5-3 years graduate traineerotation program, as first of all it is a good opportunity to learn many aspects within the company. Then during the rotations, thereare many opportunities to communicate with people from many parties learn from mentors, which are very important for personalgrowth. Moreover, If the candidate successfully complete the program, he/she would have the chance to choose to be a generalistor specialist. For me, I am very interested in risk assessment as an effective risk assessment method will prevent us from disastrousloss. In all, I believe I will learn a lot and grow up gradually in both general and special nuclear related knowledge in Amec FosterWheeler.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I had my 4-year Electrical Engineering university degree and then I had been a research assistant in risk assessment. Now I am a newgraduate with Master of Computer Science Degree at McMaster University, and currently work as a software developer in CanarieIntrusion Detection System project. With sound fundamental knowledge of engineering and science principles and programmingskills as an asset, I believe I can perform the duties assigned to me in the job.

\lettersection{Location Preference}
Toronto, ON
