%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{cvletter}
I am an experienced FrontEnd developing with strong focus on Angular, RxJS, Angular Material, Flex Layout, SCSS, Grid CSS, BEM, HTML5. 

I have worked multiple industries, including bank, on the FrontEnd development with best practices. I joined RBC in early 2021. Despite being with the team short time, I have managed to implant myself into the team and culture at Ventures. My positive attitude,sharing, willingness and interested in learning have been a welcome contribution.

 I am always trying to fully understand the tasks and concepts before diving in and knows when to ask for help. My questions are usually well thought out and comprehensive. As a collaborator, I collaborate with developers, designers and product owners to deliver better stories.
 
 I like to work in TD bank, as it fosters diversity, collaboration, and equality.

Thank you for your time and consideration!
	

%\lettersection{About Me}
%I am an optimistic person. I like to collaborate with others on projects, as I truly enjoy the atmosphere of helping each other, being open-minded, transparent, and growing together. Meanwhile I also enjoy working independently, as this allows me to work on solutions with great focus.

%\lettersection{Why TWG?}
%I learned of the opportunity through Erika Pierre via the FITC Slack channel, and I feel the job description aligns well with my skills. I was impressed with Erika's kindheartedness and willingness to help. I researched TWG online, and I was immediately attracted - talented, caring colleagues, great management, and transparent policies. I believe TWG is my next dream employer and I am very interested in being a part of this incredible team.

%\lettersection{Why Me?}
%I have 2+ years full-time experience with AngularJS and Angular 8 framework. I am interested in learning more about React and related technologies, and Vue.js. I learned Redux can help with state management in React, and state management is very important. I am able to create API services in Node.js. Currently I am improving my CSS3 skills by working on Responsive Web Design Certification via freeCodeCamp. After completing this certification, my next goal is to complete Front End Libraries Certification, where I am able to gain experience of React and Redux. I am tool-flexible and  appreciate continuous learning and professional growth. I think I would be a good fit for TWG given my personality and technical skills.
